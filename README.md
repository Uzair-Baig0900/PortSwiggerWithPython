#Disclaimer
I’m not liable for using any of these techniques described here for any illegal usage as this repository is purely for learning purposes alone.

#Prerequisites
I’ve written Hack Steps for each lab so you have an idea of what to type to write the scripts Since the repository is based on the assumption that you already know how to solve the labs with scripts and you want to practice in writing better ones. That is why you can discover that some payload is mentioned, but you cannot find exact descriptions why they are included.

#Utilizing Burp Suite
In out of band labs, I incorporated Burp collaborator as part of interception. To proceed through these labs you must have a licensed copy of Burp Pro installed, or the scripts can be adapted to leverage a remote server that you control.

#Easy Labs
But of course, there are some labs that you might find rather uninteresting in their solutions and do not really need a script for. Perhaps, solving them with no script might even be more efficient than attempting to do it with a script. I have only written scripts for these labs to make this repository complete. Of course, you can always skip them if you want to.

#Error Handling
Because this repository is for learning I have left out some bits of error handling to make it easy to follow. I think this will not much affect your script testing so much.

#Reporting Issues
In case you experience any difficulties or have ideas on how to improve these scripts while using them, you are free to open an issue. I am thankful for your comments and for your efforts to make the learning environment the best for all of us.

#Python Alternatives
If your target is to write a script for some company or organization than go ahead with Python as it has been proved to be fast. However, now let me say that if you consider optimizing for runtime and then for durability of a script, then there are better languages than Python. You should take a look at the WebSecurity Academy with Rust repository where I have completed the same labs with Rust both with single-threaded and with multi-threading.
